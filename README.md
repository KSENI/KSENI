### Hi there, it's Kseni ðŸ‘‹

This GitHub is primarily used as a repository for random code from courses, test tasks, or portfolio snippets.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on UI (Web and Mobile) and API test automation for a custom development team.

ðŸŒ± I'm open to part-time opportunities in software testing, with experience since 2016, or teaching software testing (with about 2 years of previous experience).

âš¡ Fun fact: Achieved 8th place out of 3,000 participants in a software testing challenge.
